# Intro
As a baker, I noticed just how unevenly ovens distribute heat. I created a temperature sensing device that can sense hot and cold spots, as well as calculate the average temperature.

The OLED screen rotates through two screens. The first screen displays the temperature eeach thermocouple reads and the second screen displays the average temperature of all four thermocouples. 

This project started off as just an digital oven thermometer, since all I could find were generic analogue ones. But as I conducted market research, I realized it had a wider variety of uses. From 3D printing, to detecting power outages in deep freezers, this simple product can resolve a variety of problems.
