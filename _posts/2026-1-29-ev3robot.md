# Intro
This project I worked on in middle school. We had to make some robots with the EV3 robots that had to follow a black line, pick up an object and move it onto a coloured squared. 

i liked it so much that after the semester, my teacher allowed my friends and i to come in and build the elephant during our lunches. the programming language was quite scratch-esque and our very old macbooks kept crashing, which was mildly inconvenient. 

once we completed our project, we recorded a video and presented it to the school. I then got to use the EV3 robots again in college, however we were programming them with python instead (thank goodness)
