# Intro

Rummaging through my old electronics stuff, I found my very first electronics project, the project that got me into electrical engineering! It's a pencil that "speaks" when you write with it.

I (very poorly) soldered on some devices to a partially build PCB. The way it works is that copper tape is attached to the PCB, which has a 9v battery strapped to it. If you're holding onto the copper tape and touching the graphite, as you draw the buzzer makes a sound. This means that the electricity from the 9V travels through the graphite and through you to the buzzer.

I love soldering and have gotten much better since this first project many years ago, but it was a fun find in my bag of projects.
