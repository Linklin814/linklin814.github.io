## Instructions
1. cook rice in a rice cooker (or on a stove if you're cringe). add a sprinkle of salt and some butter to the rice while it cooks.
2. melt some butter in a pan on the stove and add the frozen veg. stir periodically until it's not frozen anymore
3. add butter (or oil) to a pan and cook eggs how you like them on the stove. scrambled, sunny-side, etc. 
4. assemble by adding rice, veg and eggs to a bowl. sprinkle with soy sauce, sirachia and lime juice

## About This Recipe
This is a very fancy title for a very lazy dinner, i mean boarderline misleading. you can also add whatever seasonings sound interesting. These are some that I like paprika, pepper, ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, etc.
i do NOT recommend adding salt on top of the soy sauce unless you just really like salt. i generally buy frozen broccoli and cauliflower and edamame, but any stir-fry mix or whatever you have also work
this is a recipe i like for when i am ill since it's light and quick, however i usually skip the sirachia in those cases. It meal-preps well because the rice can be frozen and warrmed up in the microwave for even faster serving
