## About This Recipe
These are meals that got me through college. Since i cooked for myself during this time, these recipes are mostly for one. Feel free to multiply these recipes as needed. 

I would not consider myself an enjoyer of cooking, however, i, unfortunately, do need to feed myself. I don't really like eating out, wasting food or eating leftovers. So, i have put together the recipes that i made for myself. These recipes are lazy, fast and flavourful. lmk if you have any suggestions or additions
