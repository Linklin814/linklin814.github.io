## About This Recipe

These are meals that got me through college. Since i cooked for myself during this time, these recipes are mostly for one. Feel free to multiply these recipes as needed. 

This recipe is one of my favourites. Honestly, i never measure any of my seasonings, so they're just estimates. I would eat a lemon like an orange if it wasn't so bad for my teeth, so this recipe might be on the more sour side. 

To add protein, cook it as you desire (i prefer the airfrier) and add it to the top. I generally meal prep chicken, so I might defrost some, cut it up and add it on top. Salmon also does really well with this recipe. If you want to dress it up some more, add some chopped tomatoes, red onion, and paprika. This recipe is so quick and flavourful, i love it so much. There's a reason it's the first one i am adding to my webiste
